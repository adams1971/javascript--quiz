JavaScript Multiple Choice Quiz; Test Your Knowledge App

DESCRIPTION

This a short multiple choice quiz game to test the users knowledge about JavaScript. It begins with the user clicking the start button. This will begin the timer consisting of 50 seconds. The user will have this time to answer 6 multiple choice questions presented on flash cards format. For each correct answer the user will be reworded with a point towards their final score and clock will gain 5 seconds. For each incorrect answer no points will be rewarded and the clock will lose 5 seconds. All questions must be answered in order to receive any points. If at the end of the game any questions are left, the final score will be zero.
Each time a user resets the game, the question deck will shuffle the order of the questions and the order of the answers as they appear. 

At the end of the quiz, the clock will stop and open a new page notifying the user the GAME OVER. They will see their score and then will be asked to enter and submit their initials which will generate a highscores list. If there is time remaining on the clock it will be added to the overall score.At this point the user will have the option to clear highscores, play again or both.


APPROACH 

My approach to this project started with writing the HTML and the CSS. I followed a template used in our class to get me started. From there I made modifications and changed the direction I was headed. I chose not to use Bootstrap- a mistake that I now see. Starting with some groundwork would have allowed me some time to focus more on the JavaScript portion of the assignment as this is the focus of the week and the weeks to come. 

I struggled with the JS portions finding the code difficult to write and research. This week's course material was mostly new which took me some extra time to comprehend. I worked closely with my tutor to better understand how to break down this project into small parts. That was the real first lesson. From there I was able to begin understanding what was needed to make the questions appear, shuffle the answers, tally the score and make changes to the timer based on the answers. 

This being my first attempt at writing JavaScript I know I have lots to learn. I enjoyed building the game and learning more about JavaScript
